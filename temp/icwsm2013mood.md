The notion that weather plays a significant role in determining
a person’s mood is empirically beyond doubt, but quantifying
the relationship on a large scale has traditionally been
hampered by difficulties in measuring people’s sentiments. In
this paper we present the relationship between weather and
the U.S. residents’ sentiments from Twitter data and nationwide
meteorological records. We measure how temperature,
humidity, and atmospheric pressure correlate with people’s
moods, demonstrating the potential of large-scale online data
in humanities fields such as psychology. We also provide
these results with infographics, which can help the public understand
scientific results easily.
