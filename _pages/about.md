Hi there!

Kunwoo Park is an assistant professor in the School of AI Convergence at Soongsil University. His interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of language intelligence, data science, and social science. He is broadly interested in addressing societal challenges, with recent work focusing on misinformation and social bias, issues that can be propagated by both humans and generative AI.  To tackle these challenges, he formulates technical problems through dataset curation, develops language-oriented AI methods aligned with human perspectives, and applies these methods to real-world data. His work has been published in leading venues in NLP, data science, and interdisciplinary research, including ACL, WWW, and ICWSM. Since 2021, he has led the HUMANE Lab (Human-Centered Language and Data Intelligence) at Soongsil University. 

Before joining Soongsil University, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA, working with Dr. Jungseock Joo (now primarily affiliated with NVIDIA). I also held a postdoctoral position at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, where I collaborated with Dr. Haewoon Kwak, Dr. Jisun An (both now at Indiana University Bloomington), and Dr. Sanjay Chawla. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science from KAIST, under the supervision of Dr. Meeyoung Cha (now primarily affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy).

I am open to academic and industry collaborations. Please feel free to reach out!
