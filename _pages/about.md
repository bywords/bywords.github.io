Hi there!

I am an assistant professor in the School of AI Convergence at Soongsil University. My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of language intelligence, data science, and social science. I am broadly interested in addressing societal challenges, with recent work focusing on misinformation and social bias, issues that can be propagated by both humans and generative AI.  To tackle these challenges, I formulate technical problems through dataset curation, develop language-oriented AI methods aligned with human perspectives, and apply these methods to real-world data. My work has been published in leading venues in NLP, data science, and interdisciplinary research, including ACL, WWW, and ICWSM. Since 2021, I have led the [HUMANE](https://ssu-humane.github.io) Lab (Human-Centered Language and Data Intelligence) at Soongsil University. 

Before joining Soongsil University, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA, working with Dr. Jungseock Joo (now primarily affiliated with NVIDIA). I also held a postdoctoral position at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, where I collaborated with Dr. Haewoon Kwak, Dr. Jisun An (both now at Indiana University Bloomington), and Dr. Sanjay Chawla. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science from KAIST, under the supervision of Dr. Meeyoung Cha (now primarily affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy).

I am open to academic and industry collaborations. Please feel free to reach out!
