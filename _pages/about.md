I am Kunwoo Park, who will join Data Analytics group of [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://www.qcri.org), as a postdoc. I am interested in applying data science approaches to web-scale dataset (e.g., digitally logged user behaviors, online chat logs, news article) to revolutionize online systems and tackle real-world problems. Research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Detecting online misinformation or fake news
* Discovering social biases on the web environment
* Identifying factors driving user engagement

Advised by Prof. Meeyoung Cha, I recently got my PhD degree with the awarded dissertation (Title: Identification and analysis of key factors driving longevity in online social platforms).

I have published and presented related papers in top-tier CS conferences such as WWW, CSCW, ICWSM, and AAAI. I have served as a PC member in ICWSM and reviewed papers in several conferences and journals. Beside academic activities, I have also participated in several data challenges. In a recent challenge in Korea that aims to automatically detect fake news, I won the first place among college teams with a deep learning model.

I am open to chat with collaboration and future job opportunities. Feel free to contact me if you are interested. [[CV]](/files/kunwoo-cv.pdf)
