Hi there!

I am an assistant professor in the School of AI Convergence, Soongsil University. My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of language intelligence, data science, and social science. I focus on addressing societal challenges, such as misinformation and bias, by formulating technical problems through dataset constructions, developing language-oriented AI methods that align more closely with user perspectives, and applying these methods to real-world data. My work has been published in leading venues across NLP, data science, and interdisciplinary venues, including ACL, WWW, and ICWSM. Since 2021, I have led the HUMANE lab (Human-Centered Language and Data Intelligence) at Soongsil University [[Lab]](https://ssu-humane.github.io).

Before joining Soongsil University, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA, working with Jungseock Joo (now primarily affiliated at NVIDIA). I also held a postdoctoral position at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, where I collaborated with Haewoon Kwak, Jisun An (both now at Indiana University Bloomington), and Sanjay Chawla. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science from KAIST, under the supervision of Meeyoung Cha (now primarily the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy).

I am open to research collaborations! Please feel free to reach out to me at bywords.kor@gmail.com.
