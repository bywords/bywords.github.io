I am an assistant professor at the School of AI Convergence, Soongsil University. Before joining Soongsil, I was a postdoc at UCLA and QCRI. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science, from KAIST in 2018.

I am interested in tackling social problems through deep learning and language technologies using online data. My research has been published at premier computer science/interdisciplinary venues (AAAI, ACL, WWW, ICWSM, etc.). Recent interest focuses on data-centric AI for journalism/media studies.
