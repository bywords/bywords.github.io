I am Kunwoo Park, a PostDoc in Data Analytics group of [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://www.qcri.org). My research interest lies in applying data-driven approaches to user behaviors and online content of various online social systems (e.g., discussion communities, online news platforms). The dynamics of users and content in such platforms require to understand the causal relationship from digitally logged users behaviors through the lens of social science theories, but also model complex content patterns using recent deep learning approaches. I have worked on emerging social problems using both weapons of data science.

Research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Detecting online clickbaits (AAAI' 19, ongoing)
* Discovering biases in online ratings (WWW' 18, ongoing)
* Identifying factors driving user engagement (CSCW'16, WWW'17)

Recent research interest is mostly on online news.

Advised by Prof. Meeyoung Cha, I received the Ph.D. degree with the awarded dissertation (Title: Identification and analysis of key factors driving longevity in online social platforms). I have served as a PC member in ICWSM and reviewed papers in several conferences and journals. Besides academic activities, I have also participated in several data challenges. In a recent challenge in Korea that aims to detect fake news automatically, I won first place among college teams with a deep learning model.

I am open to chat with collaboration and future job opportunities. Feel free to contact me if you are interested. [[CV]](/files/kunwoo-cv.pdf)
