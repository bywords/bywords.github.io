I am an assistant professor at the School of AI Convergence, Soongsil University. I am the PI of [HUMANE Lab](https://ssu-humane.github.io). 
Our group aims to tackle online social problems, such as misinformation and hate speech, by developing data-centric technologies based on language and/or vision centered around human values.

Before joining Soongsil University, I was a postdoc at UCLA and QCRI. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science from KAIST in 2018.
My research has been published at premier computer science/interdisciplinary venues (AAAI, ACL, WWW, ICWSM, etc.).
