I am an assistant professor at the School of AI Convergence, Soongsil University, running [HUMANE Lab](https://ssu-humane.github.io). Before joining Soongsil, I was a postdoc at UCLA and QCRI. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science, from KAIST in 2018.

I am interested in tackling social problems through deep learning and language technologies. My research has been published at premier computer science/interdisciplinary venues (AAAI, ACL, WWW, ICWSM, etc.). Recent research focuses on data-centric contrastive learning.
