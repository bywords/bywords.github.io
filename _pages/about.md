I am an assistant professor at the School of AI Convergence, Soongsil University (SSU). Before joining SSU, I was a postdoc at UCLA and QCRI. I received my Ph.D. in Web Science, KAIST in 2018.

I am interested in tackling social problems through online data and data science approaches. Recent interest focuses on **detecting** misinformation and social bias in online media platforms through multi-modal analyses and **understanding** its effects on future *audience behaviors*. My technical expertise lies in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, and in particular, I have research experiences in developing deep NLP approaches and utilizing causal inference approaches. My research has been published in premier computer science/interdisciplinary conferences (ACL, WWW, ICWSM, CIKM, CSCW, AAAI) and social science/interdisciplinary journals (J. of Advertising).
