I'm leaving QCRI to join UCLA Department of Communication. I will work with [Prof. Jungseock Joo](http://jsjoo.com), who studies multimodal communication using computer vision/deep learning, in a project which aims at developing an integrated research framework for tracking information flow across multiple communication channels by automated multimodal content analysis using text, image, video, and audio.

Looking forward to joining the interdisciplinary team for the intriguing work!
