I'm leaving QCRI to join UCLA Department of Communication. I will work with [Prof. Jungseock Joo](http://jsjoo.com), who studies multimodal communication using computer vision/deep learning, in a project which aims at developing an integrated research framework for sociotechnical cybersecurity research and broader investigations of information provenance by behavioral, information, and computer scientists. Looking forward to working with great people on the ambitious project!
